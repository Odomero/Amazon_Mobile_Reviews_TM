# given unsupervised topic modelling a go, let's try supervised topic modeling
# use something call TF-IDF, which stands for "term frequency-inverse document frequency"
# general idea
# Words that are very common in a specific document are probably important to the topic of that document
# words that are very common in all documents probably aren't important to the topics of any of them
# a term will recieve a high weight if it's common in a specific document and also uncommon across all documents

# some preprocessing
# function that takes in a dataframe and the name of the columns
# with the document texts and the topic labels. If plot is set to
# false it will return the tf-idf output rather than a plot.
